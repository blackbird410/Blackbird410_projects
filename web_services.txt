Notes on Using Web services (XML and JSON)
-------------------------------------------
1- XML
------
XML is used generally to mark up data across the network. It stands for
eXtensible Markup Language.

Principal concepts:
-------------------
* Tags
* Attributes
* Serialize / De-Serialize

N.B : Serialization is the act of taking data inside of a computer in one
programming language, setting it up for transport, transporting across the
internet, taking it back apart and turning it back into the formal data it
needs to be.

- What is XML Schema ?
----------------------
It is a language that allows you to decide whether or not a particular XML
document meets a contract, an arrangement.


2- JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
------------------------------------
It is way easier and approachable than XML :).


- Service oriented approach
---------------------------
It is used to solve complex application problem where the data is not present
in only one computer system. For example if it is spread out over the
internet, connected by the internet or internal network.
